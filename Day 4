**10. What is feature scaling in machine learning?**  
a) Removing features from the dataset  
b) Converting features to the same scale  
c) Adding new features  
d) Selecting features based on importance  

**Answer:** b) Converting features to the same scale  
**Explanation:** Feature scaling ensures all features have similar scales, which helps models converge faster[3].

**11. Given the following data points: [5,[6], what is the mean?**  
a) 10  
b) 15  
c) 20  
d) 25  

**Answer:** b) 15  
**Explanation:** Mean = (5+10+15+20+25)/5 = 75/5 = 15.

---

**12. If you have two points in 2D space: A(1,2) and B(4,6), what is the Euclidean distance between them?**  
a) 3  
b) 5  
c) 7  
d) 9  

**Answer:** b) 5  
**Explanation:**  
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

**13. After min-max scaling (normalization) of the value 10 in a dataset with min=5 and max=25, what is the scaled value?**  
a) 0.25  
b) 0.5  
c) 0.75  
d) 1.0  

**Answer:** a) 0.25  
**Explanation:**  
$$
\text{Scaled value} = \frac{10-5}{25-5} = \frac{5}{20} = 0.25
$$

**14. You have a dataset with features [2, 4, 6, 8,[6]. What is the standard deviation if the mean is 6? (Hint: $$\sqrt{8}$$)**  
a) 2.0  
b) 2.8  
c) 3.2  
d) 3.6  

**Answer:** b) 2.8 (rounded from $$\sqrt{8} \approx 2.83$$)  
**Explanation:**  
Variance = $$[(2-6)^2 + (4-6)^2 + (6-6)^2 + (8-6)^2 + (10-6)^2]/5 = (16+4+0+4+16)/5 = 40/5 = 8$$  
Standard deviation = $$\sqrt{8} \approx 2.83$$ â‰ˆ 2.8.
